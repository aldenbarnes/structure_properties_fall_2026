### SF rent lookup app
Look up an apartment on RealtyAPI, pick the unit, edit any feature, and get a rent estimate from `Code/rent_model.py`. Start typing an address ("1010 an") and pick from the dropdown of real SF addresses (from `Data/properties.csv`); the city is assumed to be San Francisco. Listings are matched to the address by street address or by coordinates, and "RealtyAPI requests this session" at the bottom of the app shows exactly what was sent and returned. Features the model doesn't use (condition, parking, views, pets, utilities, lease term, unit and building amenities) are priced with premiums from published studies in `Code/feature_adjustments.py`, shown line by line under the estimate with their sources.

```
pip install -r Code/requirements.txt
streamlit run Code/rent_lookup_app.py
```

Put the RealtyAPI key in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` as `REALTYAPI_KEY = "..."` (ignored by git), set the `REALTYAPI_KEY` environment variable, or paste it in the app's sidebar. On Streamlit Community Cloud, point the app at `Code/rent_lookup_app.py` and add the key under the app's Secrets settings.
